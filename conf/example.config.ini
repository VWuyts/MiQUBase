; About config.ini ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; MiQUBase's configuration file, config.ini, handles all the
; required configuration for the MiQUBase application.

; The syntax follows these rules:
; 1. Whitespace and lines starting with a semicolon (;) are ignored.
; 2. The file includes key-value pairs as key = value.
; 3. Values containing any non-alphanumeric characters need to be enclosed in double-quotes (").
; 4. Section headers (e.g. [database]) are ignored in the MiQUBase application.
; 5. File paths should be specified with a forward slash (/).

; The name or path of this configuration file cannot be changed.
; The name of the keys also cannot be changed.
